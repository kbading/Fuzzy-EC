<!-- Do not edit README.md directly. It is automatically created from README.rmd -->

This project has a `Makefile`.
In RStudio, after re-loading the project, you may hit `Ctrl + Shift + B` to run analyses.
If you already installed [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) on your system (which should be the case if you installed git bash),
you may also `cd` to the repository folder and run `make`.
